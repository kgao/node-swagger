# Kev's first Skeleton project for Swagger

A web based API documentation tool powered by swagger module for node.js

# Quick start

## 5. Run the server

Run the project server.

```bash
$ swagger project start
```

## Now, call the API!

It just works!

```bash
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:10010/hello?name=Kevin
"Hello, Kevin!"
```


### <a name="openeditor"></a>Open the Swagger editor

The Swagger editor lets you design and test your API interactively. While you design and test, the API documentation is generated automatically for you.

Now that we've got our basic API running, let's open the Swagger editor.

1. Be sure you're in your project root directory: `./hello-world`.

2. Fire up the editor: `swagger project edit`


```bash
Starting Swagger Editor.
Opening browser to: http://127.0.0.1:62650/#/edit
Do not terminate this process or close this window until finished editing.
```
